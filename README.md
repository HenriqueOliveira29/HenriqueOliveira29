<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Henrique Oliveira</h1>

<p>A passionate developer with a love for building meaningful software solutions. I enjoy working across different tech stacks and collaborating with the community to create applications that make a difference.</p>

<h2>🛠️ What I'm Into</h2>
<p>I'm particularly interested in full-stack development, with hands-on experience in:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Backend Development</strong>: Building robust APIs and services</li>
    <li><strong>Frontend Development</strong>: JavaScript, creating engaging user interfaces</li>
    <li><strong>Problem Solving</strong>: From concept to deployment, I love the entire development journey</li>
</ul>

<h2>📂 Current Project: Reading Community App</h2>

<p>I'm building a vibrant community platform for book enthusiasts. Over the past year, I've developed a daily reading habit that has evolved into a passion. While platforms like Goodreads exist, I believe there's room for something better—a space where readers can genuinely connect, share their thoughts, and engage in meaningful discussions about the books they love.</p>

<p><strong>My Vision:</strong> A social media platform specifically designed for readers, with an emphasis on community engagement and discussion rather than just book discovery.</p>

<h3>Project Goals:</h3>
<p>This project is my opportunity to master the complete software development lifecycle:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Build a Robust Backend</strong> - Implement industry best practices to create a secure, high-performance, and maintainable API</li>
    <li><strong>Design an Intuitive UI</strong> - Craft a clean, accessible, and user-friendly interface that encourages community interaction</li>
    <li><strong>Set Up CI/CD Pipeline</strong> - Establish automated testing and deployment workflows to streamline the release process</li>
    <li><strong>Deploy to Production</strong> - Host the application on my Raspberry Pi server and configure it for real-world usage</li>
    <li><strong>Master DevOps & Infrastructure</strong> - Learn and implement modern technologies including VPNs, firewalls, server management, and security best practices to safely expose the application to the world</li>
    <li><strong>Have Fun!</strong> - Most importantly, enjoy the learning journey and the satisfaction of building something meaningful 🚀</li>
</ol>
